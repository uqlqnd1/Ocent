## Ocent Reviews

Ocent has been building its reputation in the Chinese and Asian gaming server market. Based on their public server showcase and service offerings, here's what users typically experience:

**Performance & Reliability:**
Ocent operates its own network infrastructure with BGP routing, which provides stable connectivity across multiple regions. Their focus on game server hosting means the infrastructure is optimized for low-latency, real-time applications. The 30-second deployment time for game servers demonstrates their streamlined provisioning system.

**Pricing & Value:**
The hourly billing model is particularly attractive for users who want to run temporary game servers or test environments. Monthly prices range from approximately ¥25.99 (about $3.60 USD) for entry-level plans to several hundred yuan for high-performance options. This pricing is competitive within the Chinese hosting market, especially considering the bandwidth allocations.

**User-Friendly Features:**
- Proprietary control panel designed specifically for game server management
- One-click installation for popular game server software
- Support for multiple game versions and mods
- Easy server switching between different games

**Regional Advantages:**
For users targeting audiences in China, Japan, or broader Asia-Pacific regions, Ocent's local data center presence provides significant latency advantages over Western hosting providers. Their Japan nodes are particularly popular for both Chinese and international gamers.

**Support & Documentation:**
Ocent provides a documentation center (docs.ocent.net) with guides and tutorials. Their business hours are listed as weekdays from 14:00 to 23:59 (China time), with support available via email at support@ocent.net and phone at 027-59266631.

**Considerations:**
- Primary interface and support are in Chinese, which may present a language barrier for non-Chinese speakers
- Service is optimized for Asian markets; latency may vary for users in other regions
- Documentation and community resources are primarily in Chinese

**Public Server Examples:**
Ocent showcases numerous public game servers running on their infrastructure, including popular Minecraft servers like "2b2t" and various community servers. This transparency allows potential customers to see real-world performance examples.
